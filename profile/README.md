# FIREPLUG

Our project addresses two key scientific challenges:

i) to manage a transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy to address climate change, and

ii) to minimize the effects of land use change from renewable energy on biodiversity and ecosystem services. 

Hydro, wind and solar power are key to green energy production but future planning needs a better understanding of the tradeoffs among different options. Our collaborative team includes three research institutions (NINA, NTNU, and CICERO), five NGO environmental groups, and a 
government authority (NVE). Our project is structured as 7 integrated work packages (WP). In WP1, we will develop alternative scenarios of renewable energy development informed by stakeholder and societal values. Scenarios will explore tradeoffs between upgrading vs. building of new facilities, small vs. large-scale hydropower projects, siting of wind turbines in different habitats, and building electricity grids in networks vs. corridors. In WP2, we will assess impacts of land use from different scenarios with new spatial tools to evaluate  area requirements in land and freshwater habitats. In WP3, we will address impacts on carbon budgets by evaluating energy effects on carbon storage and sequestration in natural systems. In WP4, we will investigate biodiversity impacts by modeling spatial impacts of 
energy on species and habitats of conservation concern. In WP5, we will use our model results in Life Cycle Assessment to assess temporal and spatial tradeoffs across the lifespan of energy facilities. In WP6, we will develop visualizations of alternative scenarios with 
Consensus-Based Siting as a planning tool to incorporate technical needs while safeguarding biodiversity. In WP7, we will identify economic incentives for our best scenarios, and to develop new policy recommendations for decision-makers in Norway. Our interdisciplinary project will provide valuable new solutions for renewable energy and land under pressure in Norway
